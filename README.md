Horama provides the implementation code for the research paper:

- *Unlocking Feature Visualization for Deeper Networks with MAgnitude Constrained Optimization* by Thomas Fel*, Thibaut Boissin*, Victor Boutin*, Agustin Picard*, Paul Novello*, Julien Colin, Drew Linsley, Tom Rousseau, RÃ©mi CadÃ¨ne, Laurent Gardes, Thomas Serre. [Read the paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10154).

In addition, this repository introduces various feature visualization methods, including a reimagined approach to the [incredible work of the Clarity team](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/) and an implementation of [Feature Accentuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10039) from Hamblin & al. For an official reproduction of distill's work complete with comprehensive notebooks, we highly recommend [Lucent](https://github.com/greentfrapp/lucent). However, Horama focuses on **experimentation** within PyTorch, offering a compact and easily hackable codebase.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Horama

Horama requires Python 3.6 or newer and several dependencies, including Numpy. It supports both Tensorflow and Torch. Installation is straightforward with Pypi:

```bash
pip install horama
```

With Horama installed, you can dive into feature visualization. The API is designed to be intuitive across both Tensorflow and Pytorch frameworks, requiring only a few hyperparameters to get started.

Example usage:

```python
import torch
import timm
from horama import maco, fourier, plot_maco

%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

model = timm.create_model('resnet18', pretrained=True).cuda().eval()

objective = lambda images: torch.mean(model(images)[:, 1])

image1, alpha1 = maco(objective)
plot_maco(image1, alpha1)
plt.show()

image2, alpha2 = fourier(objective)
plot_maco(image2, alpha2)
plt.show()
```

# Complete API

Complete API Guide
Horama's API includes the following primary functions:


```python
maco(objective_function,
     total_steps=1000,
     learning_rate=1.0,
     image_size=1000,
     model_input_size=224,
     noise=0.1,
     values_range=(-2.5, 2.5),
     crops_per_iteration=6,
     box_size=(0.20, 0.25),
     device='cuda')

fourier(objective_function,
        decay_power=1.5,
        total_steps=1000,
        learning_rate=1.0,
        image_size=1000,
        model_input_size=224,
        noise=0.1,
        values_range=(-2.5, 2.5),
        crops_per_iteration=6,
        box_size=(0.20, 0.25),
        device='cuda')

```

When optimizing, it's crucial to fine-tune the hyperparameters. Parameters like the decay spectrum in the Fourier method significantly impact the visual output, controlling the energy distribution across frequencies. Additionally, adjust the values_range to match your model's preprocessing requirements, and ensure model_input_size matches the expected input size of your model. Typically, setting the noise parameter to about 10% of the input range yields satisfactory results.

# Additional Resources

A simpler and maintain implementation of the code for Tensorflow and the other feature visualization methods used in the paper come from the [Xplique toolbox](https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique). Additionally, we have created a website called the [LENS Project](https://github.com/serre-lab/Lens), which features the 1000 classes of ImageNet.

For a code faithful to the original work of the Clarity team, we highly recommend [Lucent](https://github.com/greentfrapp/lucent).
